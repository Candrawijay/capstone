# **MilQuCheck: Milk Quality Assessment and Monitoring Application**  

### **Project Overview**  
MilQuCheck is an innovative application designed to address the persistent challenge of inconsistent milk quality in the dairy industry, particularly for small-scale producers. By leveraging machine learning and modern mobile technologies, the app enables efficient, real-time assessment of milk quality based on critical health indicators. MilQuCheck is designed to empower both producers and consumers with actionable insights, educational resources, and tools to improve milk handling practices, reduce waste, and ensure safety. The app also promotes sustainable practices, contributing to public health and helping producers access broader markets
